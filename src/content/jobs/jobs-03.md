    "As a Digital Developer at Mortenson Kim, my duties included building animated HTML5 banners, HTML emails, and Wordpress websites.",
    "My biggest challenge was keeping up with the frantic pace of work, especially during the busy season when I was initially hired. To keep up with the demand, I setup a Webpack configuration, a custom plugin, and some boilerplate code to speed up the process. To further speed things up, I wrote a Photoshop script to speed up the collection of CSS styles.",
